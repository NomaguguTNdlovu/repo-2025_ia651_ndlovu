## Introduction
The current subjective methods for determining soccer player value and wages often lead to inefficienct player recruitment, inequitable salary negotiations, and suboptimal contract offers for soccer players, hence the need to bridge the gap.

### Overall Goal
To analyze the factors that influence a soccer player's value and wages using FIFA 2022 data and develop predictive models to estimate these attributes based on key player characteristics based on the top 10 rated players.

### Objectives
1.	Explore the relationships between a playerâ€™s key attributes and their Wages.
2.	Using supervised learnin techniques to develop predictive models to estimate player wages and overall ratings based on certain player attributes (e.g. age, position, potential, and skill moves). 
3.	Validate the models by assessing their performance and selecting the best-performing model based on evaluation metrics (like R-squared, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Mean Squared Error (MSE)).
4.	Provide actionable insights and recommendations that can assist soccer clubs in making informed decisions about player recruitment, salary negotiations, and contract offers.

## Data Source
Source of the Data: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bryanb/fifa-player-stats-database?select=FIFA22_official_data.csv   
Year: 2022
Structure: 16 710R * 65C
168 Nationalities represented
16 089 Unique players represented

### Justification of data source period
While more recent data might offer some advantages, the 2022 dataset proved to provide a strong foundation for achieving the project's objectives of exploring relationships, developing predictive models, and providing actionable insights for football because of the vast attributes it contained.
